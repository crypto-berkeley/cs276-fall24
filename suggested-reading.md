## CS 171
*	Course materials from [CS 171 - Spring 2024](https://eecs171.com/) (Undergraduate Cryptography). This is the precursor to our course, and we assume students are familiar with the content.
*   Katz and Lindell's textbook [Introduction to Modern Cryptography](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~mfy/moderncrypto/reading%20materials/Introduction_to_Modern_Cryptography.pdf) is written at an advanced undergraduate level and matches much of the curriculum from CS 171.

## CS 276
*	Scribe notes for this semester are found in our [shared Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/4483254187fjrmyctxzxfq#d396c1) and can be viewed by compiling `collection-F24.tex`. 
*	[Scribe notes from past semesters](/assets/lecture-notes/CS_276_Old_Scribe_Notes.pdf)
*	Course materials from a previous iteration of this course: [CS 276 - Fall 2014](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg/assets/classes/cs276-fall14/)
