There are three kinds of assignments:
*   **Problem Sets** typically involve writing proofs. They are assigned weekly.
*   **Research Project:** Students will work on a research project related to cryptography. Students can pick the topic and work in groups. They should aim to produce publishable results by the end of the semester or at least make progress in that direction.
*   **Scribe Notes:** Each student will write scribe notes for one lecture.

### Grading
Final grades are based on the following weighted combination of assignment scores:
*   40% Problem Sets
*   40% Research Project
*   20% Scribe Notes

### Late Policy
Assignments submitted late will lose 5% for every hour that they are late. For example: if you submit 1 minute late, you lose 5%. If you submit 61 minutes late, you lose 10%.


## Problem Sets
Problem sets will typically involve writing proofs. They are assigned weekly.

### Self-Scoring
After the answer key is posted, you will score your submission based on how rigorous and correct your solutions are, using the following rubric:
* 5 points: The submission is complete and correct. 
* 4 points: There are small mistakes or gaps in the solution.
* 3 points: The main approach is right, but there are major gaps in the solution.
* 1 or 2 points: The main approach is not correct.

The score value that you give your submission will not affect your actual grade.

The self-scoring is due one week after the problem set is due.

### Grading
You don't have to write a perfect solution to get a perfect score. You will receive full credit if you attempt every problem, get most of the details correct, and complete the self-scoring.

**Drop Policy:** We will drop your lowest 2 problem set scores.

### Collaboration
You are encouraged to collaborate with other students on the problem sets, but you must write your solutions individually and list all of your significant collaborators. You may collaborate with other students by explaining the meaning of a question, or exploring a potential approach to solving the question. However, you should never possess, read, or copy from another student's exact solutions.

Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you should not copy solutions verbatim, and you must cite all your sources.

Any student found to be violating these policies or cheating otherwise risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Center for Student Conduct.

## Research Project
For the research project, you may work in groups and submit one project report for the whole group.

## Scribe Notes
Each student will write scribe notes for one lecture. Sign up to scribe a lecture [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174bPvR3db2Uvda138NZWzITQixrS3XxK4Cn-1Ie1gLM/edit?usp=sharing).

Write your scribe notes in our [shared Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/4483254187fjrmyctxzxfq#d396c1). If you're scribing lecture 4, for instance, create a file called `lec04-F24.tex` for your scribe notes. You may find it useful to copy from old scribe notes. They can be found in the `Old Scribe Notes` folder and can be previewed by compiling the `Old Scribe Notes/collection.tex` file.

Your notes are due within 1 week after the lecture you scribed. After that, please make any revisions to your notes that the course staff may suggest.
