## Assignments
There will be two kinds of assignments:
*   **Problem sets:** Assigned weekly
*   **Reviews:** After a problem set is due, you will be assigned to review another student's submission and give feedback. You should indicate whether their solution is fully correct and if not, identify the details that are lacking or incorrect. Also indicate if their writing is unclear and give constructive feedback to help them improve. In general, your reviews should be respectful and kind. Also, they can be short or long; the length doesn't matter.

## Collaboration

You are encouraged to collaborate on problem sets with fellow students, but you must write your solutions on your own and list all of your significant collaborators. You may collaborate with other students by explaining the meaning of a question, or exploring a potential approach to solving the question. However, you should never possess, read, or copy from another student's exact solutions.

Similarly, you may use books or online resources to help solve homework problems, but you should not copy solutions verbatim, and you must cite all your sources.

## Cheating

Any student found to be cheating risks automatically failing the class and being referred to the Center for Student Conduct.

## Submission

*   All assignments are due by 8:59 PM on the due date.
*   **Late policy:** Assignments submitted late will lose 5% for every hour that they are late. For example: if you submit 1 minute late, you lose 5%. If you submit 61 minutes late, you lose 10%.

## Grading
*   Assignments will largely be graded on completeness. A submission will receive full credit if it attempts every problem and gets most of the details correct.
*   **Drop policy:** We will drop your lowest 2 problem set scores.
